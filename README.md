# Your-Study-Space

# Introduction
Welcome to Your Study Space!
This is your all in one study platform with a timer to time your study sessions, a list to add your tasks to do, and all customization and tasks are saved and rendered when you log in!

Hosted at: https://your-study-space.netlify.app/

Note: Unfortunately, due to Heroku no longer offering its free services, the backend of the application is not deployed, so signing in and saving a list of your to-do tasks is currently not working. I hope to redeploy on another service by the end of August 2023. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Hope to get back to :)
While the absolutely essential is fully operating, more great features that will be implemented in the future include: creating study rooms with friends, selecting different Pomodoro studying patterns, changing your study home screen, and more!
